assignment for class using Fire Base
# Firebase-Assignment - Train-Scheduler
## In this assignment we use a firebase database to store input data taken from the HTML in the form of a train scheduling app.
I'll be honest. This one threw me for a loop. In class we'd been calling APIs with AJAX and extracting from the JSON-formatted data what we wanted on the screen, e.g. GIPHYs, movie summaries, etc. So this one I reasearched a collaberated with other people. I was able to make a few variables but ended up cleaning them up when I talked with other classmates. Also found some code online that helped with moment.js which was also shared with classmates. Used lots of pieces from our in class activities.
**There is an extra logic.js that I was working on
